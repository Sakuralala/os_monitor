before run,you need to install:
  apt install xx:
  1.python3.x
  2.mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
  
  pip install xx:
  1.MySQLdb
  2.flask
  
  after that,you need to configure:
    1.mysql 
    create 4 tables in a database:
      a.mem_info,which includes 4 fields in order:mem_usage(float),mem_used(bigint),mem_free(bigint),time(int)
      b.cpu_info,which includes 5 fields in order:cpu_usage(float),user_time(float),sys_time(float),idle_time(float),time(int)
      c.disk_usage,which includes 2 fields in order:disk_usage(float),time(int)
      d.net_info,which includes 3 fields in order:send_package(int),recv_package(int),time(int)
    2.in root directory,make 2 directories as the official document of flask said:
      a.static
        put bootstrap.min.css bootstrap.min.js jquery.min.js echarts.min.js into static,which can be easily downloaded by searching 
        the keywords.
      b.templates
       put the html into this directory.
  finally,run get_osinfo.py first,this process will write to the database per second;then run flask_web.py,and open your browser,open
  0.0.0.0:8889,then all would be ok.
